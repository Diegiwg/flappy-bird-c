# Flappy Bird in C üê¶

**This is a Study Project: "Flappy Bird Clone in C"**

## About the Project

### What is Flappy Bird?

Flappy Bird is a popular skill-based game where a bird must fly through an obstacle course, avoiding collisions with pipes, while maintaining a steady and balanced flight path. Your goal is to achieve the highest score by navigating through the obstacles.

### Project Objective

The aim of this project is to create a simplified version of Flappy Bird in C, exploring concepts such as keyboard input, character control, game logic, and rendering in the Windows terminal. It utilizes the `windows.h` library to create an interactive terminal interface.

## How to Use the Project

1. Clone this repository to your development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegiwg/flappy-bird-c.git
```

2. Open the project in your development environment (for example, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, etc.).

3. Compile the source code and run the program.

4. Use the space bar to control the bird and navigate through the obstacles. The goal is to see how long you can keep the bird flying and how many obstacles you can pass.

5. Have fun exploring the source code and experimenting with modifications to enhance the game or learn more about C programming.
